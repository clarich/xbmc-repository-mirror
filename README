Selective mirror of xbmc official repo, unofficial repos and addons that are not in any repos.
Contains addons that only iterest me or my friends/family and are english.
I remove xbmc's official repo and just use this one so I only see English addons.
sync.pl is the perl script that maintains all this.
addons_xml_generator.py is my version that doesn't use regex to get proper addon versions.
